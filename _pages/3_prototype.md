Our first prototype tests the essential technologies for our application.
It has a frontend and backend that communicate.

### Backend
The backend has a SpringBoot api to allow the frontend to communicate with it and a database of over a thousand projects.

### Frontend

The frontend is a React application which includes a map (using MapBox), search and chart which demonstrate the behaviour using sample data.
