### Plan for Term 2
The plan for term 2 is to add more features from our MoSCoW list. In the first term we implemented good structures and designs for how the mapping application should work but the features were lacking. In the second term we need to add the features that we intended to before.

We will also look to see how we can optimise the speed of the application and how it might scale for large traffic.
