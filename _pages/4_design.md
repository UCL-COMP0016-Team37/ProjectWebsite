Our design involved collecting data using the backend and sending it to the frontend where it is displayed and can be navigated intuitively by users. Our tool enables users gain an insight into how NGOs and CSOs operate around the world by using maps, charts and search.

When a user first opens the site they are presented with an overview of the data, a map showing the number of projects in different regions. When the user zooms into this map they will be the regions are made smaller so they can see how many projects in each country. When the user clicks on a country it opens a page that allows the user to search and analyse the projects in that country.

Another overview chart is the top 100 funders. This paginated chart clearly shows the distribution of funders.

We designed our frontend to be easy to user requiring no instructions on how to use it however we thought it would be best to provide a help page to help those that need it. The help page explains how to use the major features of the tool including step by step pictures.

Searching is very important when dealing with a large data sets. Our search tool allows searching the title and description of activities and also filtering by country and sector. After a search result is sent the search results can be viewed and any of the projects can be opened to view a detailed breakdown on their project page. Alternatively for a search result the user can click view analysis which shows graphs and maps based on the search results. The user can switch the graph type and it will update all the graphs.

On the project page a map displays the location of the activity if it has one. Information about the activity overview, budgets, transactions, related activities and locations.
