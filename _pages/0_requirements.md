### Project Motivation

The ANCSSC (Alliance of NGOs and CSOs for South-South Cooperation) is a UN supported organisation for networking, knowledge sharing and capacity building for NGOs and CSOs in the developing world. The ANCSSC requires a visual mapping tool for displaying their own members project's. The tool will use IATI data which could then be replaced later with the ANCSSC's member's data. When the tool uses IATI data it could be used by NGOs and CSOs to understand the types of projects, donors and locations. They could use this tool to understand the data and create strategies to maximise their impact. CSOs and NGOs often do not have enough time or resources to do fundraising research. 
Data licensing also needs to be taken into account, most of the IATI data is open to use and modify however some do not so the tool could keep track of this.
